# Haskell is a Compiling language. 
GHC compiles `.hs` programs into 3 new files. `.hi`, `.o`, and then a basic *executable.* for which you can run.
Alternatively run a Haskell program interpretively using *`runhaskell` or `runghc`.*

# Haskell is an Imperative programming language. 
I'm not quite sure what that means but I know it isn't object-orientated programming.
